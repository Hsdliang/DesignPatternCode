# DesignPatternCode
This repository lists the Java design pattern with code.

I opened Java Pattern Code program as code training and thinking practice. With the experience grow in my work, I find Object Oriented can not only used in program, it can also apply to life routine. For instance, when I made the System Upgrade Manual to introduce information for new college learning, the singleton pattern gave me help. The manual is composed by many part and every part use same sequence list. Obviously, this same sequence list can copy with the original list. Then, the original list how to create? One way is to write every number, the other is use the WPS Sequence Creator. Firstly, for easy , I took the Creator, but when I copied it to other part the sequence number auto incremented, and all part sequence list became one sequence. Finally, hand write every number is better solution. 

From this event, I realized that the sequence list just is the Java object, and this operation is the design pattern's application. WPS Sequence Creator has state and write every number is independent.

Even though I learned some Design Pattern, I still fell some anxiety and a little confused. So I decided to use the Java code to make those Pattern deeper learning.
